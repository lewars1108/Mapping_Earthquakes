# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

As the new data visualization specialist for the disaster reporting network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world, I am tasked with building insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. Basil, the head of the earthquake disater response team believes that this projet will be useful for his team which include reporters and data visualization specialists. He hopes that making earthquake maps informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones will generate positive buzz about the Disaster Reporting Network. I will support website and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. I will traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
